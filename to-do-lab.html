    <!--0.  Make some of the style a bit nicer by following the instructions in the css file -->
    <!--1.  USING ICONS
    We'll want to use a nice "+" icon for adding items to our list, to
    replace the paragraph that just says "Plus."
    -Visit the fontawesome website at fontawesome.com
    -Then go to https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started?using=web-fonts-with-css
    and use the given link tab in your html to link the fontawesome resources to your page.
    We often use links for external files that we write (like css), but we can also link resources from
    elsewhere on the web, like fontawesome.
    -Check out the list of icons https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery and find a nice plus icon.  Put
    it in the html in the appropriate spot and make sure it shows up.

    <!-- USING MORE FONTS
    2. Find a nice font: https://fonts.google.com/
    Go to "Select this font" and then "family selected" to find the html and css you need to modify in order for <thead>
    font to show up in your header (or your entire body, if you choose).
